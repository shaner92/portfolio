                        I am an individual who is fascinated with learning. 
                        I am passionately interested in Education, People, and Tech.
                        My passion for education and learning makes me an active listener, 
                        a curious individual, and inevitably a lifelong learner. 
                        I see myself as a self-starter and a driven learner, 
                        also enjoying a stimulating conversation, a strongly supported argument. 
                        I enjoy the challenge of problem solving, analytical thinking , 
                        being an innovative learner, and a versatile athlete. 
                        My interests are also hiking, good music, 
                        football and most importantly revamping my baking and cooking skills.</p>
